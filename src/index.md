title: About
---
I am a full-time web developer at [üéè Glitch][]. I'm based in [Portland, OR][pdx].

Previously I was at [Mozilla][] for 7 years. I worked on marketing webpages, improved tools supporting Firefox developers, built the infrastructure for Firefox's experiment pipeline, wrote add-ons, and more.

I've done a bunch of work with [Python][] and [JavaScript][]. I have significant experience with [Django][] and [React][].

I play a fair amount of games. I first started programming as a child making games with [ZZT][].
