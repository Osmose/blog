body:

I am a web developer working for [Mozilla][] in [Portland, OR][pdx]. I make tools and services that help support others, particularly those working on Firefox. I've been with Mozilla since 2011.

I've done a bunch of work with [Python][] and [JavaScript][]. I have significant experience with [Django][] in particular.

I play a fair amount of games. I first started programming as a child making games with [ZZT][].
